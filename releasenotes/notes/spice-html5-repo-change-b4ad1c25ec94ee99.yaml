    Recently the spice-html5 git repository was entirely moved from
    ``https://github.com/SPICE/spice-html5`` to
    ``https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-html5``. This results
    in a failure in the git clone stage of the ``repo-build.yml``
    playbook for OSA pike releases earlier than ``16.0.14``.
    To fix the issue, deployers may upgrade to the most recent release,
    or may implement the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      nova_spicehtml5_git_repo: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-html5.git
