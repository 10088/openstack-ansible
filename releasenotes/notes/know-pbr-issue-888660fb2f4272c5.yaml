    If newton is still in use and a new build is executed, the repo-build
    process will fail due to a new PBR library release which was issued
    after newton was declared end-of-life (EOL). This issue will show up
    if gnocchi is being used in the environment and may also show up as
    a venv build failure for other services.
    This issue can be resolved either by upgrading the environment to a
    recent OpenStack-Ansible Ocata release, or by doing the following.

    * Fork the ``openstack/openstack-ansible-repo_build`` git repository.
    * Create a ``stable/newton`` branch in the fork based on the ``newton-eol``
      tag.
    * Cherry-pick https://review.openstack.org/557757 into the fork on that
      branch.
    * Fork the ``openstack/openstack-ansible`` git repository.
    * Change the ``ansible-role-requirements.yml`` file to include the URL
      and git SHA for your patched fork of the repo_build role.

    Once this is done, the repo build process should complete as it did
    before and the updated software can now be deployed.
