upgrade:
  - |
    Ironic Inspector service was bumped to master version instead of
    stable/ussuri. Which means that during upgrade to this version Inspector
    version will be downgraded, which may result in problems with migrations.
    We recommend to ensure you have full DB backup before Inspector upgrade
    or overwrite ironic_inspector_git_install_branch with 10.4.0 tag
