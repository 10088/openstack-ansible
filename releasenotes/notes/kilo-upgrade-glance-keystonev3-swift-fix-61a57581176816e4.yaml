upgrade:

    The Kilo upgrade playbook `glance-db-storage-url-fix.yml` to Liberty will
    migrate all existing Swift backed Glance images inside the
    image_locations database table from a Keystone v2 API URL to a v3 URL.
    This will force the Swift client to operate against a v3 Keystone URL.
    A backup of the old image_locations table is stored inside a new database
    table `image_locations_keystone_v3_mig_pre_liberty` and can be safely
    removed after a successfull upgrade to Liberty.

    This upgrade task is related to
    `bug 1582279 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1582279>`_.
