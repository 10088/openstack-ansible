upgrade:
  - |
    The default method for download roles has been switched from ``galaxy`` to
    ``git-clone``. This has no functional effect, but is now required in order
    to successfully download the ``ceph-ansible`` repository. In order to
    prevent clashes between the old and new roles, the existing
    ``/etc/ansible/roles/ceph*`` folders should be removed prior to running
    ``scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh`` during the minor upgrade process.
fixes:
  - |
    The ``ceph-ansible`` individual role repositories were all removed from
    github on around 16 January 2019, causing the bootstrap-ansible script to
    fail for any new deployments, or during upgrades for environments which
    had these roles previously. To replace them, the ``ceph-ansible`` git
    repository is used instead.
