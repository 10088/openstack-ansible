    The ``ceph-ansible`` individual role repositories were all removed from
    github on around 16 January 2019, causing the bootstrap-ansible script to
    fail for any new deployments, or during upgrades for environments which
    had these roles previously. To replace them, the ``ceph-ansible`` git
    repository is used instead. In order to prevent clashes between the old
    and new roles, the existing ``/etc/ansible/roles/ceph*`` folders should be
    removed prior to running ``scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh`` during the minor
    upgrade process.
