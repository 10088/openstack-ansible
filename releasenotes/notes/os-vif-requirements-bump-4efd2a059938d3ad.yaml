    The requirements version has bumped to pull in os-vif 1.15.2, which contains
    the fix for OSSA-2019-004 / CVE-2019-15753. Operators using linuxbridge
    networking (the default in openstack-ansible) should update immediately.
    The fixed package will be installed in the nova venv upon re-deployment
    of nova using the os-nova-install.yml playbook. Afterwards, verify that
    the ageing timer on neutron-controlled linux bridges displays as "300.00"
    raher than "0.00" using ``brctl showstp <bridge name>``.
