issues:
  - Ceilometer does not support V3 endpoints in Liberty,
    which are the flavor created by OSA. To deploy
    Ceilometer some endpoints in the Keystone service
    catalog must be removed and replaced with V2
    endpoints. This is neccessary, for example, to use the
    Swift pollster to collect metrics for Swift storage
    use the Swift endpoint. For detailed instructions on
    the steps for these changes to the service catalog see
    the `OpenStack Liberty Install Guide
    <http://docs.openstack.org/liberty>`.
