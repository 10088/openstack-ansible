    The upgrade playbook `nova-flavor-migration.yml` will perform a migration
    of nova flavor data. This will need to be completed prior to upgrading to
    Liberty. It is recommended that Kilo be deployed from the `eol-kilo` tag
    prior to upgrading to Liberty to ensure that this task is completed
    successfully.

    This upgrade task is related to
    `bug 1594584 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1594584>`_.
