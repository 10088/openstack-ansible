    LXD 2.0.11 grew a new feature ('description' tag for a container)
    and this has been added to the stable Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 release.
    Unfortunately, pylxd 2.0.5 can't handle this extra attribute and
    crashes out.

    For newton releases 14.2.14 and earlier, we recommend pinning the
    LXD version for all newton deployments at a version less than
    2.0.11. For newton releases 14.2.15 onwards, the newer release of
    LXD should be usable again.
