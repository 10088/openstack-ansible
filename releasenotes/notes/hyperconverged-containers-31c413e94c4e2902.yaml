    When upgrading from pike to queens there are the following
    changes to the container/service setup.

    * All cinder container services are consolidated into
      a single ``cinder_api_container``. The previously implemented
      ``cinder_scheduler_container`` can be removed.
    * A new ``heat_api`` container is created with all heat services
      running in it. The previously implemented ``heat_apis_container``
      and ``heat_engine_container`` can be removed.
    * All nova services are consolidated into the ``nova_api_container``
      and the rest of the nova containers can be removed.

    Playbooks have been added to facilitate this process through
    automation. Please see the ``Major upgrades`` chapter in the
    Operations Guide.
