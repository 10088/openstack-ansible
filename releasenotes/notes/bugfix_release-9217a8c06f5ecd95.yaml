    This is minor bugfix release that brings up overall improvements and
    bugfixes to the roles.
features:
  - |
    Added variable `nova_scheduler_extra_filters` which allows to extend
    list of defaulted `nova_scheduler_default_filters`
  - |
    Added deployment of the `keystone_auth_default_policy.json` file
    for Magnum.
fixes:
  - |
    uWSGI service restart is now properly triggered upon service config change
  - |
    Notifications are enabled now if either ceilometer or designate service is
    present in the inventory
  - |
    Fixed ceph_client role for distro installs
upgrade:
  - |
    String value of `nova_scheduler_default_filters` is converted to the list
    At the moment there is compatability for overriden values, that are string,
    but this support will be removed in the Wallaby release. So deployers are
    recommended to replace their string overrides with list ones.
security:
  - |
    MariaDB version updated to 10.3.25, which covers CVE-2020-2574
