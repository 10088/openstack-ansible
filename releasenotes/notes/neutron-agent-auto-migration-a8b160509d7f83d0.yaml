    During an upgrade using the run-upgrade script, the neutron agents will
    now automatically be migrated from the neutron_agents containers on to
    the network_hosts. The neutron_agents containers will be deleted as they
    are no longer necessary. Any environments which previously upgraded to
    Queens can make use of the same playbooks to handle to migration, or
    inspect the playbooks to determine how to do it by hand if preferred.
