# This file should only be used to set python package pins that are
# not present in OpenStack's upper-constraints. Any pins present in
# this file will override any requirements set in *requirements.txt,
# upper-constraints and any roles/vars.
#
# Use this file with caution!
#

# Due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1660800, gnocchiclient
# must be pinned to < 3.0.0. This constraint matches what is defined in
# the optional dependencies specified here:
# https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/stable/newton/setup.cfg#L36
gnocchiclient>=2.2.0,<3.0.0

# Due to changes in LXD the pylxd library version set in the
# openstack/requirements repo upper-constraints file no longer
# works. We override that constraint with a newer release.
# See:
#  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pylxd/+bug/1736454

pylxd===2.0.6
