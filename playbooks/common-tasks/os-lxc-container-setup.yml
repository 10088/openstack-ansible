# Usage:
#  This common task will update lxc containers to use the lxc-openstack
#  app-armor profile by default however this profile can be changed as needed.

#  This will also load in a list of bind mounts for a given container. To load
#  in a list of bind mounts the variable, "list_of_bind_mounts" must be used
#  containing at least one dictionary with the keys "bind_dir_path",
#  "relative_bind_dir_path", and "mount_path".
#    * bind_dir_path = Container path used in a bind mount
#    * mount_path = Local path on the physical host used for a bind mount

#  If extra container configurations are desirable set the
#  "extra_container_config" list to strings containing the options needed.
