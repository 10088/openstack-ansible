# The version of PBR >= 0.11.0 breaks this plugin (contrib package) so the package has been removed
# from the build process until the PBR issues are resolve upstream which is related to all of the
# services transitioning to Liberty. Note that the package will still be available as its presently
# part of the upstream index as found here: http://rpc-repo.rackspace.com/pools/heat_contrib_extraroute/
# BUG: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1450733
