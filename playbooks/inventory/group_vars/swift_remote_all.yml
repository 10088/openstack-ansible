# These vars are required by swift_remote_all hosts because of the way ansible
# expands hostvars which have vars passed through filters - since remote hosts
# won't have these vars they are unable to expand the hostvars of "local"
# swift hosts which reference these vars. They aren't actually needed by
# swift_remote_all hosts, or swift hosts in general - they just need to be set.
